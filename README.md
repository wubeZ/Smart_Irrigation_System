# Smart-Irrigation-System
## Smart Irrigation system using Embedded C language

## Overview
The objective of this project is to irrigate the plant automatically using an Embedded System. By using pH and Moisture sensors, we can find whether the soil is wet or dry. If it is dry, water pumping will pump the water. In case of need of nutrients to the soil the pH sensor senses and sprinkles the fertilizer to the plant. 

The software used are MPLAB and Proteus for Simulaton.
